The primary concern is the absence of explicit mentions of specific industry-standard EDA tools and certain legacy scripting languages (Perl, TCL/Tk, SKILL). However, their demonstrated ability to 'optimize workflows,' 'implement automation,' and 'develop agile scripts and tools' in a CAD setting suggests a high degree of adaptability and a strong learning curve for new tools. I recommend proceeding with an interview, focusing on assessing their functional knowledge of EDA tool capabilities, problem-solving approaches in a multi-tool environment, and their aptitude for quickly acquiring proficiency in specific missing tools/languages.\"\n",
