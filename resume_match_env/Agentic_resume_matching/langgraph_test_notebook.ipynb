      "**Global Calculation Parameters Used:**\n",
      "*   **Current Date for \"Present\":** October 2025\n",
      "*   **Precision:** All final `years_of_experience` values are rounded to one decimal place.\n",

      "*   **No skills were removed due to non-existence in the resume.** All extracted skills were explicitly mentioned or clearly inferable.\n",
      "*   **No false positives were identified for removal.** The initial extraction successfully avoided common false positives like job titles (e.g., \"Software Engineer\"), company names, or purely generic phrases without skill context.\n",
      "*   **No skills were merged due to duplication.** While \"VCS (Version Control Systems)\" is a broad category encompassing \"Git\" and \"Perforce\", the validation rules specify keeping related but distinct skill variations separate (e.g., \"SQL vs MySQL\"). Thus, \"VCS\" was kept as a higher-level skill.\n",
